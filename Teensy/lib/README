IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT NANOPB FOLDER
=====================================================
The directory "nanopb" is supposed to be a directory junction (symbolic link) on Windows to /components/nanopb.
This way we share the exact same code between Teensy and ESP.
If the symlink doesn't show up for you, please DO NOT edit anything in the /Teensy/lib/nanopb folder, 
instead edit /components/nanopb. This includes recompiling the .proto files.
Thanks.
=====================================================

This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
|  |
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.c
|  |     |- Bar.h
|  |  |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.c
|  |  |- Foo.h
|  |
|  |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
   |- main.c

and a contents of `src/main.c`:
```
#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

int main (void)
{
  ...
}

```

PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder will find automatically dependent
libraries scanning project source files.
