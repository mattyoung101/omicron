# OpenMV code
This directory contains the **legacy** camera code that was previously used in 2019 and 2018. It ran on an OpenMV H7 module.

It has since been superseded by Omicam.

_The main camera script is tracking.py, with whitebal_cal.py used to calibrate the white balance for a new environment._
