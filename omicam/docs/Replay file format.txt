- TODO: wouldn't it make more sense to write a delimited protobuf message which has a repeated
field which contains ReplayFrame messages?

OMIREPLAY
OmicamVersion

MessageBegin
MessageId
MessageSize
MessageContents
MessageEnd


What we need to encode:
- Time in miliseconds since application launch to nearest int (this is a timestamp)
Do we need to use microseconds?
- Localised position
- Received orientation
- Goal data: seen, x, y, etc

What we could also add:
- Localisation status code (may need to add anyways)
- JPEG image of field (LARGE FILE)
- Thresholds too? (LARGE FILE)

Would it make sense just to write out RemoteDebug packets to disk???
Could add two modes, verbose replay and lite replay
