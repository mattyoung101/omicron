Notes from today (22/06/2020):
- Discrediting rays doesn't work. I tried ignoring rays if their cm distance was outside 55cm (approximate model range) 
but it makes it a lot worse. Better to leave them in. 
- Good results using polynomial instead of exponential: 5th order polynomial works really well (0.999 R^2 too). The
polynomial regression is now the default approach in the calibration view.
