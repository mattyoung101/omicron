Our team members are: Name Primary responsibilities Original team Contact Lachlan Ellis Movement code J-TEC TBA Tynan Jones Electrical design J-TEC TBA Ethan Lo Mechanical & electrical deign, movement code, docs Omicron TBA James Talkington Mechanical design J-TEC TBA Matt Young Vision systems developer, docs Omicron TBA (TODO: will need to be fixed for stupid robocup rules to hide one contributor ugh) Our members are all very experienced, having competed in previous internationals competitions. Our team collectively also has many victories and podium placements in Australian Nationals, States and Regionals competitions. We have been preparing for this competition for about (TODO: how many?) months and we estimate to have a combined (TODO: put hours here) hours developing and improving our current iteration of robots. Our current robots This year, our team brings many new and exciting innovations to the table, as well as reliably building on and improving previously developed technologies. Some new innovations we have developed this year include: Omicam : our custom vision pipeline developed to replace the OpenMV H7. Programmed in C, running on a Jetson Nano, this device is capable of 720p@60fps (TODO: please confirm) field object tracking, and centimetre accurate field localisation using only camera data (no LRFs, etc) via a novel approach that uses non-linear optimisation algorithms. Omicontrol : our custom, wireless, all-in-one robot control software. Written in Kotlin, this program is used to tune our cameras, move robots around and visualise sensor data. Mouse sensor and velocity control : our robots have fully working PWM-3360 mouse sensors, which we use to accurately estimate and control our robot's velocity on the field, in addition to interpolating our localisation data. Advanced strategies : using the above projects, our movement software developers have combined highly accurate localisation data with precise velocity control to enable the execution of advanced ball-manipulation strategies on the field. Wheels(?) Double dribbler and kicker(?) Some technologies we build upon this year include: FSM : last year, we introduced the concept of a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) as a novel method of organising robot behaviour through a graph of inter-connected state machines, each which contains a series of states that can be \"switched\" through. This year, we continue to build upon this technology, introducing more state machines and more states. PCBs (modular?)
