# Finite State Machine

We inheret our Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM), implemented by us in C on the ESP32, from last year.

**Note:** Due to COVID and development delays, our FSM implementation remains unchanged from last year (with
a few minor bug fixes). Hence, most of this documentation is borrowed from the RoboCup 2019 Sydney submission
by our previous team (Deus Vult).

**TODO attach docs.**
