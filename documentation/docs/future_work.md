# Future ideas
Although this was the last year of our competition, we nonetheless have a few remaining ideas we would have liked to
research:

- A method for automatic camera threshold calibration using the same Subplex algorithm as used in the localiser (model
as 6 dimensional optimisation problem).
- Properly implement and test strategies
- Finish a few unfinished/untested Omicam and Omicontrol features
- Fix all remaining bugs
- Implement a better communication protocol with more reliability
- Predict the velocity of the ball and supply it to the goalie for interception
- Better inter-robot communication, transmit more information, test more
