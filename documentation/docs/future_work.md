# Future ideas
Although this was the last year of our competition, we nonetheless have a few remaining ideas we would have liked to
research:

## Software
- A method for automatic camera threshold calibration using the same Subplex algorithm as used in the localiser (model
as 6 dimensional optimisation problem).
- Implement a better communication protocol with more reliability
- Predict the velocity of the ball and supply it to the goalie for interception
- Better inter-robot communication, transmit more information, test more

## Hardware
- If we had lots of money/space, it would be nice to include a 360 LiDAR to compliment the camera software (particularly
for robot detection)
