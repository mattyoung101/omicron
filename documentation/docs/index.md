# BBC Robotics - Team Omicron

Welcome to the official documentation website for Team Omicron, a robotics team from Brisbane Boys' College in Queensland, 
Australia, competing in RoboCup Junior Open Soccer at the Bordeaux 2020 Internationals.

This website contains all the information about our robot's hardware, electrical and software design. Please feel
free to browse at your own pleasure, and don't hesitate to contact us by visiting the About page. We're more than happy
to answer any questions you may have about any aspect of our robots!

You may also be interested in reading our [team description paper](#), although it doesn't contain anything not already 
listed on our website.

Some time in the next year or so (from competition date), our entire codebase including mechanical designs, electrical designs and 
all software will become open source for everyone to learn from and study. The exact timeframe is still yet to be determined,
and depends on a variety of factors, so we don't have a particular date in mind right now but we can assure you it will happen.
