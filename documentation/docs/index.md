# BBC Robotics - Team Omicron

Welcome to the official documentation website for Team Omicron, a robotics team from Brisbane Boys' College in Queensland, 
Australia, who would have been competing in RoboCup Junior Open Soccer at the Bordeaux 2020 Internationals.

This website contains all the information about our robot's hardware, electrical and software design. Please feel
free to browse around, and don't hesitate to contact us by visiting the About page. We're more than happy
to answer any questions you may have about any aspect of our robots!

Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, our team sadly never got a chance to compete in competition. Instead, we have released
all of our source code for every project, hardware designs (mechanical and electrical), documentation and notes under permissive
open source licences! Check it out here: [Open source release](open_source_release.md)
