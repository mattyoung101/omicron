# Low-level code
Team Omicron is proud to work at a lower level than many other teams in the RoboCup Jr competition.

Most of our gameplay code runs on the ESP32 and is written in plain C11 using Espressif's
IoT Development Framework (as opposed to Arduino). 

**Note:** Due to COVID and development delays, most of our low-level code is the same as last year (with
a few minor bug fixes). Hence, most of this documentation is borrowed from the RoboCup 2019 Sydney submission
by our previous team (Deus Vult).
