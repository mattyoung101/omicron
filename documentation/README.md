# About

This is the documentation for team Omicron 2020. We use MkDocs to convert markdown files into a full website to document 
our development of the robot.

# Instructions for team members who are the only people who are going to read this hopefully

To start, please clone the teamomicron git repo in the root directory of this git project with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/TeamOmicron/teamomicron.github.io.git

To deploy the website, go to the path of the github team (which should be ~/teamomicron.github.io) and use this command:
